        "5--->The FamilySize feature tells us how many family members a passenger had on the ship. This helps the model because people who were with their families might have had a better chance of surviving since they could help and look out for each other. On the other hand, people who were alone (FamilySize = 1) might not have had anyone to help them, making survival harder. Using one simple number for family size is also easier for the model to understand than using two separate columns for siblings/spouses and parents/children.\n",
